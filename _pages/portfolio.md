This portfolio is a compilation of several projects which I have carried out. created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## BI Projects

### Adventure Works BI Report
[report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiM2EyNjIyMTctOTk5NC00MmM2LWFkNDEtN2Q4OWJjNjRhNjEyIiwidCI6IjBmODNlMjdiLTQ4YjMtNGZkNC05M2QzLTE4YzllNDNiNjA5NiIsImMiOjl9)

Working with data from the popular Adventure Works database from Microsoft, I was able to transform the raw data, build a relational data model, add calculated fileds using DAX and finally deliver a professional-quality, end-to-end business intelligence report.

## Machine Learning and AI Projects

### Predicting User Engagement via Ads

[notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mrAlakija/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20User%20Engagement/Predicting%20user%20engagement%20via%20ads.ipynb) [github](https://github.com/mrAlakija/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20User%20Engagement/Predicting%20user%20engagement%20via%20ads.ipynb)

Working with a fake advertising data, I will use scikit-learn to predict if a particular internet user clicked on an ad based of certain
certain features of each user.

### Restaurant Recommendation using Azure Matchbox Recommender

[Azure Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Restaurant-Recommender-3)

Cloud based project using sample data from Microsoft's machine learning studio, a matchbox recommender algorithm(cognitive based filtering) was used to suggest restaurants for customers based off prior customer and restaurant data. The model scored a Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
of 91%.

### Classify Song Genres from Audio Data

[notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/Classify%20Song%20Genres%20from%20Audio%20Data/notebook.ipynb) [github](https://github.com/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/Classify%20Song%20Genres%20from%20Audio%20Data/notebook.ipynb)

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), a classifier was trained to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com/).

### Predicting Credit Card Approvals

[notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals/notebook.ipynb) [github](https://github.com/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals/notebook.ipynb)

Using data from the Credit Card Approval [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) to build a machine learning model with scikit-learn so as to predict if a credit card approval will get approved or not

### Super-Bowl

[notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game/notebook.ipynb) [github](https://github.com/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game/notebook.ipynb)

Analysing the Super-bowl over the years to find out if viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time. Who the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances and how the game affects television viewership

## Natural Language Processing and Data Mining

###  Word Frequency in Moby Dick

[notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/Word%20Frequency%20in%20Moby%20Dick/notebook.ipynb) [github](https://github.com/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/blob/master/Word%20Frequency%20in%20Moby%20Dick/notebook.ipynb)

Using the python libraries _Beautiful Soup_ to scrape data off the web and _Natural Language ToolKit_ (nltk) to process this data, we find the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, __Moby Dick__, and how often these words occur
