This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## DataCamp Projects

### [Classify Song Genres from Audio Data](https://github.com/mrAlakija/Datacamp-Portfolio-Projects/tree/master/Classify%20Song%20Genres%20from%20Audio%20Data)

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), a classifier was trained to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com/).
