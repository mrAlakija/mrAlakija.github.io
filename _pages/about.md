I am an Engineering and IT professional capable of adding value to companies and societies using technology and data. 

When I am not on site carrying out inspections or managing databases, I spend my time learning Data Science and how it can be applied for social good. I am passionate about making a local impact in my community, no matter how small, so after getting a firm understanding of the field I decided to start applying all I've learnt so far. 

Recently, I was involved with the **Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program** [tradermoni](https://www.tradermoni.ng/index.html) scheme as a Data Analyst where I used exploratory data analysis to glean information and provide actionable insights to help the Government understand how better to target their donor base.

When Iâ€™m not doing any of these things, I'm restaurant hopping with the aim of discovering the best delicacies the city has to offer or I'm probably in a gym trying to kill off calories.

I live in Canada and Nigeria but before that, I lived for 3 years in Scotland where I got my Masters and also did some volunteering work.
