When I am not carrying out site inspections, developing business intelligence reports or managing databases, I spend some of my free time learning about Emerging Technologies such as Machine learning, deep learning and Artificial Intelligence and their application for social good. With an ability to learn quickly, I was able to get a solid understanding and implement some of these technologies.

Recently, I was involved with the **Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program** [Tradermoni](https://www.tradermoni.ng/index.html) scheme as a Data Scientist where I was tasked with cleaning and validating data and applying predictive modelling techniques in order to help the Government understand how better to target their donor base.
