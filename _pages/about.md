Engineering and IT professional, with over 8 years of industry experience, who continues to seek to add value to organizations, societies and individuals using data and technology. 

Strong analytitical thinking and communication skills paired with a familiarity with tools such as Power BI, SQL and Python, I am able to glean relevant information and provide actionable insights from data. Experience with database technologies (SQL Sever, Microsoft Access), database management tools and data warehousing. 

When I am not carrying out site inspections, developing business inteligence reports or managing databases, I spend some of my free time learning about Emerging Technologies such as Machine learning, deep learning and Artificial Inteliigence and how they can be applied for social good. With an ability to learn quickly, I was able to get a solid understanding and implement some of these technologies

Recently, I was involved with the **Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program** [Tradermoni](https://www.tradermoni.ng/index.html) scheme as a Data Scientist where I used exploratory data analysis and machine learning models to glean information and provide actionable insights to help the Government understand how better to target their donor base.

I live in Nigeria and Canada but before that, I lived for 3 years in Scotland where I got my Masters and also did some volunteering work.
