I am an Electrical Engineer with a Masters in Information Technology. With over 8 years’ of practical experience, I have been able to acquire extensive knowledge in Data Management, Data Analytics, Electrical Building designs and  Data Warehousing.

When I am not on site carrying out inspections or back at the office managing databases, I spend my time learning Data Science and how it can be applied for social good. I am passionate about making a local impact in my community, no matter how small, so after getting a firm understanding of the field I decided to start applying all I've learnt so far. Recently, I was involved with the **Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program** [tradermoni](https://www.tradermoni.ng/index.html) scheme as a Data Scientist where I used exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms to help the Government understand how better to target their donor base.

When I’m not doing any of these things, I'm restaurant hopping with the aim of discovering the best delicacies the city has to offer or I'm probably in a gym trying to kill off calories.

I live in Canada and Nigeria but before that, I lived for 3 years in Scotland where I got my Masters and also did some volunteering work.
